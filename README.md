Here's a movie recommendation system I created for fun long time ago, employing machine learning techniques ,

To make it work, First open the folder in VS Code , Second open a new terminal (make sure u are using conda) , and lastly type "streamlit run app.py" , to be honest i could make it work in another simpler way but where is the fun in that(I was feeling lazy) .
